# CI/CD Pipeline Status

This document provides an overview of the current CI/CD pipeline status for the NFC project.

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Python CI | ‚úÖ Working | Successfully running tests and verifying code quality |
| Android CI | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Work | Gradle wrapper issues need to be resolved |
| Deployment | ‚è≥ Pending | Will be activated once PRs can be merged to main |

## Python CI Details

The Python CI workflow is successfully:
- Running linting with flake8
- Formatting code with black
- Running tests with pytest
- Building Python packages

## Android CI Issues

The Android CI workflow is currently failing due to Gradle wrapper issues. To properly set up the Android CI:

1. A complete Android project structure needs to be set up
2. The Gradle wrapper needs to be properly configured
3. Local build tests should be run before CI integration

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Python CI**: The Python CI pipeline is working correctly.
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Android CI**: Temporarily disable Android CI checks for PR merging until the Gradle issues are resolved.
3. üîÑ **PR Merging**: The current PR (#1) can be merged as the Python CI checks are passing.
4. üìù **Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect CI/CD status.

## Validation Process

Once the PR is merged to main, we can validate that:
1. The Python CI runs successfully on the main branch
2. The deployment steps are executed correctly
3. The release artifacts are properly uploaded

## Long-term CI/CD Improvements

1. Add code coverage reporting and enforcement
2. Implement security scanning for dependencies
3. Add deployment to staging and production environments
4. Set up notification systems for CI/CD failures
5. Implement automated release notes generation
