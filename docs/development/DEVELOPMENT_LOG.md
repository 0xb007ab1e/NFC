# NFC Reader/Writer System - Development Log

## Fundamental Rules (MUST BE FOLLOWED)
1. **No code writing until detailed design and implementation plan is complete**
2. **All tasks must be completed, tested, and verified before marking as complete**
3. **Progress tracking mechanism must be maintained throughout development**
4. **Each context must be seeded with these requirements**
5. **No code generation until explicitly instructed by the project lead**

## Purpose
This document serves as a detailed log of all development activities, decisions, and progress for the NFC Reader/Writer System. It complements the PROGRESS_TRACKER.md by providing more detailed information about implementation details, challenges, decisions, and future modifications.

## Current Development Phase
**Phase 1: PC Server Development**

## Development Log Entries

### 2025-06-23: Project Repository Setup and Database Models Implementation

#### Activities Completed
- Set up project repository structure with proper directory organization
- Initialized Git repository with main and develop branches
- Configured GitHub workflows for continuous integration
- Created issue and PR templates
- Implemented database models using SQLAlchemy ORM:
  - Base model with common fields and functionality
  - NFCTag model for storing tag information
  - NFCRecord model for storing record data within tags
  - Device model for tracking connected Android devices
  - Connection model for logging connection sessions
  - User model for authentication and authorization
- Set up database configuration and connection management
- Implemented database migration infrastructure using Alembic
- Created Pydantic schemas for API request/response validation

#### Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Ensuring compatibility between SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production
  - **Solution**: Implemented conditional database URL configuration and connection parameters
  
- **Challenge**: Proper handling of UUID fields across different database backends
  - **Solution**: Used SQLAlchemy's dialect-specific types and added proper type conversion in model methods

#### Technical Decisions
- Using UUID as primary keys for all models to ensure uniqueness across distributed systems
- Implementing a BaseModel class for common fields (id, created_at, updated_at)
- Storing complex data as JSONB for flexibility (tech_list, parsed_data, etc.)
- Using relationship cascades for proper cleanup of related records
- Implementing a comprehensive migration system for database schema evolution

#### Future Modifications Planned
- Optimize database indexes for performance once query patterns are established
- Add more sophisticated validation for NFC data formats
- Consider implementing soft delete functionality for data archiving
- Evaluate connection pooling settings for production deployment

### 2025-06-23: API Design and Implementation

#### Activities In Progress
- Setting up basic API framework with FastAPI
- Implementing health check endpoint
- Planning API routes organization

#### Next Steps
- Implement NFC tag and record API endpoints
- Create device registration and management endpoints
- Develop connection management API
- Implement authentication and authorization

#### Technical Decisions
- Using FastAPI for high performance and automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Implementing a consistent error handling mechanism across all endpoints
- Using dependency injection for database sessions and authentication
- Structuring API routes by resource type (NFC, device, connection, etc.)

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Style and Structure
- Follow the coding standards defined in CODING_STANDARDS_PYTHON.md
- Keep modules focused on single responsibility
- Use type hints consistently
- Document all public functions, methods, and classes
- Write tests for all functionality

#### Performance Considerations
- Optimize database queries for large datasets
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use asynchronous operations for I/O-bound tasks
- Monitor memory usage for potential leaks

#### Security Best Practices
- Validate all input data
- Sanitize output to prevent injection attacks
- Use secure defaults for all components
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## Technical Debt Tracking

This section tracks items that should be addressed in future iterations:

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting based on user, IP, and endpoint
2. **Connection Pooling**: Fine-tune database connection pooling for production
3. **Documentation Generation**: Set up automatic API documentation generation and hosting
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring system
5. **Containerization**: Create Docker configuration for easier deployment
