# NFC Reader/Writer System - Project Overview

## Fundamental Rules (MUST BE FOLLOWED)
1. **No code writing until detailed design and implementation plan is complete**
2. **All tasks must be completed, tested, and verified before marking as complete**
3. **Progress tracking mechanism must be maintained throughout development**
4. **Each context must be seeded with these requirements**

## Project Description
An Android application system that enables NFC data scanning and transmission to a PC server via USB or WiFi connectivity through API calls.

### Core Components
1. **Android Application ("Readr/Writer")**
   - NFC data scanning capabilities
   - USB and WiFi connectivity options
   - API client for data transmission
   - User interface for operation control

2. **PC Server Application**
   - Basic data logging functionality
   - API endpoint for receiving NFC data
   - USB and WiFi communication support
   - Data storage and management

### Primary Communication Methods
- **USB Connection**: Direct device-to-PC communication
- **WiFi Connection**: Network-based communication via API calls

### Current Phase
- **Phase 0**: Design and Planning (CURRENT)
- Code implementation will NOT begin until this phase is complete

## Project Timeline
- Phase 0: Design and Planning (Current)
- Phase 1: PC Server Development
- Phase 2: Android Application Development
- Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment

## Success Criteria
- Complete design documentation before any coding
- Working progress tracking system
- Functional NFC data transmission
- Reliable USB and WiFi connectivity
- Basic data logging on PC server
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
