# NFC Reader/Writer System - Implementation Checklist

## Fundamental Rules (MUST BE FOLLOWED)
1. **No code writing until detailed design and implementation plan is complete**
2. **All tasks must be completed, tested, and verified before marking as complete**
3. **Progress tracking mechanism must be maintained throughout development**
4. **Each context must be seeded with these requirements**
5. **No code generation until explicitly instructed by the project lead**

## Purpose
This document provides a detailed checklist for the implementation of each component of the NFC Reader/Writer System. It serves as a reference to ensure all required functionality is implemented correctly and completely.
