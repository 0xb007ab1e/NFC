# NFC Reader/Writer System - Phase 1 Kickoff Preparation

## Fundamental Rules (MUST BE FOLLOWED)
1. **No code writing until detailed design and implementation plan is complete**
2. **All tasks must be completed, tested, and verified before marking as complete**
3. **Progress tracking mechanism must be maintained throughout development**
4. **Each context must be seeded with these requirements**

## Phase 1 Overview: PC Server Development

Phase 1 focuses on developing the PC server component of the NFC Reader/Writer system. This server will act as the central data processing and storage hub, receiving NFC data from Android devices via USB or WiFi connections.
